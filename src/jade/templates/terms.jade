                                            p When you launch a Clickberry application you provide us with four types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us; locational use information collected by us as you interact with our services; usage information that is collected by our servers as you use our applications; and information related to third party services that you would like to access through our applications and services.
                                            p When you register with Clickberry, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, username, your email address and a photo representation ("avatar") and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.
                                            p When you launch or interact with a Clickberry application, we collect your device type and IP address. This information is gathered for all users. In addition, we use the unique Device ID ("UUID") that vendors such as Apple and Android licensees makes available for each device in order to authenticate the user session. This UUID functions similarly to a persistent cookie to make it possible to authenticate the user without the need for a password. You can disassociate a UUID from a user account at any time by emailing us at support@Clickberry.com.
                                            p When you use Clickberry applications, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior videos or messages you have posted or easily see the list of people you follow. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.
                                            p You post User Content through Clickberry applications at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post with Clickberry will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in Clickberry applications. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived form or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.
                                            p Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Clickberry applications is a violation of the Clickberry Terms of Service and should be reported to support@Clickberry.com.
                                            p If you choose to use our invitation service, we may ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as the recipient's email address and we will automatically send a one­time email or instant message inviting him or her to visit the site or to download our application. Clickberry stores this information to send this one­time invitation, to register a new connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. The person you invited may contact us at support@Clickberry.com to request that we remove this information from our databases.
                                            p Clickberry may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of Clickberry applications through the operation of the service in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.By using Clickberry, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

                                            p You can configure certain third party services to be accessed by Clickberry applications and services. When you do so, we will store your access credentials to such third party services in a secure manner; we may temporarily cache your list of contacts from these services; and we will store messages, videos, and other content created using our applications that are delivered to such third party services. We do this to improve the performance and experience of these services (such as, adding videos and location information not available in the third party services).

                                            p When you register with Clickberry, you create your own profile.
                                            p Your name, username and avatar (but not email address) are displayed to other Clickberry users to enable you to connect with people on Clickberry. We expect that you will use the name which you are most commonly known by. We may occasionally use your username or email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Clickberry that we think you may find valuable. Your profile can be shared across all of the applications in the Clickberry portfolio. As a previously registered user, when you download and access a new Clickberry application, your user profile is automatically incorporated into that new application.
                                            p Clickberry may send you service­related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a person you follow posts a new video, you may receive an email or other notification alerting you to that fact. These announcements may also relate to new product launches or other relevant information about Clickberry and the services we provide. Clickberry may use information in your profile or related to your activities on Clickberry applications in order to personalize the application experience for you. Clickberry may also share information such as user trends and application downloads in aggregate to third parties without identifying you as an individual.

                                            p Clickberry is about users sharing information with others.
                                            p We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) necessary for business operations (e.g., emailing you through a third party server), 2) legally required or when we choose to collaborate with a law enforcement agency in the investigation of a possible crime, 3) permitted by you.
                                            p If the ownership of Clickberry, Inc. were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre­existing Privacy Policy.

                                            p Clickberry users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Clickberry account may do so by emailing us at support@Clickberry.com. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to members of Clickberry.
                                            p Clickberry services and applications have communication features that allow you to share information with other individuals on Clickberry, however, you generally cannot remove such communications.

Any person who provides their personal information to Clickberry through its Services must be 13 years of age or older. If we learn that personal information of persons under the age of 13 years has been collected on one of our Services we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
                                            p If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a Service account, then you may alert us at support@Clickberry.com and request that we delete that child's personal information from our systems.
